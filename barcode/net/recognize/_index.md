**How to recognize barcodes in C#**, .NET Barcode API can do it easily. Programmers can read barcodes at any angle. API provides [BarCodeReader class](https://apireference.aspose.com/barcode/net/aspose.barcode.recognition/barcodegenerator), having the image containing code as parameter as well as developers can pass DecodeType as parameter. Get all codes via its [ReadBarCodes](https://apireference.aspose.com/barcode/net/aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition/barcodereader/methods/readbarcodes). Iterate through each code and get its type and text.
