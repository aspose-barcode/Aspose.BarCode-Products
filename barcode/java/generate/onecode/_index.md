 In order to create USPS ONECODE barcode , weвЂ™ll use
 [Aspose.BarCode for Java](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use barcode API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-barcode) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.
