 In order to create MATRIX 2 OF 5 barcode , we’ll use
 [Aspose.BarCode for C++](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use barcode API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.barcode) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.BarCode.Cpp** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.BarCode for C++ API" %}}

 Aspose.BarCode is a barcode reader and generation API. It can easily decode and generate 1D, 2D and postal barcodes of multiple symbologies. Developers can easily integrate it in any barcode generation and scanning application. Moreover, Generated barcodes can easily be exported to different high-quality image formats. Its a standalone library and does not require any additional software installation. ‎
