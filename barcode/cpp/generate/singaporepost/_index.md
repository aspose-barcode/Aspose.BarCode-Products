 Aspose.BarCode is a barcode reader and generation API. It can easily decode and generate 1D, 2D and postal barcodes of multiple symbologies. Developers can easily integrate it in any barcode generation and scanning application. Moreover, Generated barcodes can easily be exported to different high-quality image formats. Its a standalone library and does not require any additional software installation. вЂЋ

```cs

// Create barcode generator
System::SharedPtr<BarcodeGenerator> barcodeGenerator = System::MakeObject<BarcodeGenerator>(EncodeTypes::SingaporePost, u"1234567");
barcodeGenerator->get_Parameters()->set_Resolution(300);
// Generate barcode and save as image
barcodeGenerator->Save(u"output.jpg"); 
// Use the relevant EncodeTypes as of here Singapore Post is used
