**How to recognize barcodes in C++**, using C++ Barcode library, Programmers can recognize barcodes at any angle easily. API provides [BarCodeReader class](https://apireference.aspose.com/barcode/cpp/class/aspose.bar_code.bar_code_recognition.bar_code_reader), having the image containing code and DecodeType as parameter. Get all codes via its Read() method. Iterate through each code and get its type and text.

{{% blocks/products/pf/feature-page-section  h2="Recognize Code 39 Barcode" %}}

**C++ BarCode Scanner API** is capable of reading multiple symbologies from a single image. Process of reading or decoding Code-39 barcode images is, Use BarCodeReader class, having image containing Code39 code and [DecodeType](https://apireference.aspose.com/barcode/cpp/class/aspose.bar_code.bar_code_recognition.decode_type).Code39Standard for Standard CODE 39 or Code39Extended for Extended CODE 39 as parameters. Iterate through each code to get it.

For any C++ based QR code reader and scanner application, programmers can easily integrate the below code or modify it as of their requirement. Even if the image may contain multiple symbologies at the same time including QR code. API can easily detect each symbology and its code text.  Process of reading QR code is almost same i.e create BarCodeReader class object with relevant image and type, Iterate through each code and get the text. Developers can also read other symbologies as listed.
