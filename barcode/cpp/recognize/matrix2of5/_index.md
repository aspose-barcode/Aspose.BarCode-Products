 In order to read MATRIX 2 OF 5 barcode , we’ll use
 [Aspose.BarCode for C++](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use barcode API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.barcode) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.BarCode.Cpp** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

1.  Create a new instance of BarCodeReader class
1.  Set path to the image containing Matrix2of5 barcode with full path as a parameter
1.  Set the relevant DecodeType as second parameter
1.  Loop through each result
1.  Get Matrix2of5 barcode text using GetCodeText

System::SharedPtr<BarCodeReader> barCodeReader = System::MakeObject<BarCodeReader>(u"sourceImage.png", DecodeType::Matrix2of5);

// Read all the barcodes from the image
while (barCodeReader->Read()){
	// Display the codetext
	
	System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(u"BarCode CodeText: ") + barCodeReader->GetCodeText());
}	
barCodeReader->Close(); 
// Use the relevant DecodeType as of here Matrix 2 of 5 is used

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.BarCode for C++ API" %}}

 Aspose.BarCode is a barcode reader and generation API. It can easily decode and generate 1D, 2D and postal barcodes of multiple symbologies. Developers can easily integrate it in any barcode generation and scanning application. Moreover, Generated barcodes can easily be exported to different high-quality image formats. Its a standalone library and does not require any additional software installation. ‎
