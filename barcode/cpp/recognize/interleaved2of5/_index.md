 In order to read INTERLEAVED 2 OF 5 barcode , we’ll use
 [Aspose.BarCode for C++](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use barcode API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.barcode) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.BarCode.Cpp** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

1.  Create a new instance of BarCodeReader class
1.  Set path to the image containing Interleaved2of5 barcode with full path as a parameter
1.  Set the relevant DecodeType as second parameter
1.  Loop through each result
1.  Get Interleaved2of5 barcode text using GetCodeText
