 Aspose.BarCode is a barcode reader and generation API. It can easily decode and generate 1D, 2D and postal barcodes of multiple symbologies. Developers can easily integrate it in any barcode generation and scanning application. Moreover, Generated barcodes can easily be exported to different high-quality image formats. Its a standalone library and does not require any additional software installation. вЂЋ

 You need
 [aspose.barcode.dll](https://downloads.aspose.com/barcode/cpp) 
 referenced in your project to execute the following workflow.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Create a new instance of BarCodeReader class
1.  Set path to the image containing DataMatrix barcode with full path as a parameter
1.  Set the relevant DecodeType as second parameter
1.  Loop through each result
1.  Get DataMatrix barcode text using GetCodeText

```cs

// Create an instance of BarCodeReader, set image and DecodeType type to recognize
System::SharedPtr<BarCodeReader> barCodeReader = System::MakeObject<BarCodeReader>(u"sourceImage.png", DecodeType::DataMatrix);

// Read all the barcodes from the image
while (barCodeReader->Read()){
	// Display the codetext
	
	System::Console::WriteLine(System::String(u"BarCode CodeText: ") + barCodeReader->GetCodeText());
}	
barCodeReader->Close(); 
// Use the relevant DecodeType Data Matrix, GS1 Data Matrix
